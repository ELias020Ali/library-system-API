Title
Project Management Approach

Context and problem statement 
For the Library Management System to be completed on time, efficient management is essential. To manage activities, monitor progress, and adjust to changing needs, a strategy is needed. Depending on the groupsâ€™ workflow and the level of difficulty of the project, it is essential to choose between an Agile methodology and a classic waterfall model.

Considered options
The Waterfall Model, a phased, sequential process with well-defined deliverables at every turn. Ideal for tasks that require less repetitiveness and have set requirements. The alternative, Agile Methodology, is a constant process that emphasises ongoing input from the client and delivery. Agile encourages communication, adaptability, and teamwork, allowing for changes as the project progresses. The final option, The hybrid model, combines repetitive Agile cycles for development tasks with the formal planning of Waterfall for significant milestones.

Decision outcome 
We have chosen to adopt an Agile methodology for project management. Agile is perfect for collaborative development and feature refinement based on user feedback since it allows for numerous changes and flexibility to accommodate said changes. Regular meetings will keep the group focused on the right set of goals.

Consequences 
Agile lowers the possibility of delayed surprises by enabling us to adjust to shifting needs and guaranteeing a consistent progress assessment. Nonetheless, it calls for self-control to stick to sprint objectives and encourage team collaboration.

Pros and Cons of Options
Agile technique is perfect for adjusting to making changes and receiving feedback into account since it provides flexibility, quicker delivery, and increased collaboration. By spotting problems early, it improves risk management and gives priority to high-value features. Strong communication is necessary, scope creep is possible, and frequent meetings result in increased management overhead. For teams who are unfamiliar with Agile methods or have fixed budgets, it may also be more unpredictable and difficult.
