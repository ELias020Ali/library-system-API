Title 
Languages & Applications

Context & problem statement
It is important to pick the correct programming language to support the library management system, as it is the backbone of the system. On the development side, it is important that all members of the team are familiar with the language in order to create the perfect management system. 

Considered option 
The first set of decisions we came across was the choice between creating a web-based application or a Windows form based one. Originally we decided to create a web-based application due to the overall freedom of design it comes with; HTML, CSS, and Javascript were languages that we had used before to create a web-based application. However the problem came from the backend side, we havenâ€™t had much experience with APIs as much. The other option was to create a windows form based app; we have a lot more experience in creating an application this way.

Decision Outcome 
Our decision to create a windows Form-based application stemmed from the experience and familiarity we have with the language C# as well as the ease of design. We decided to go with a simple design as it is a library management system, and we thought that in terms of the design of the front-end, it does not need to be an extensive one.


Consequences 
This decision will lead to a lack of front-end design as web-based languages have more freedom in terms of design. 




Pros and Cons of the Options 
Lack of design for user interface
Familiarity with Language: Using C#, a language your team is comfortable with, can significantly speed up development time and reduce learning curve delays.
Stable and Secure: Windows Forms applications can be more secure when deployed on a local network, avoiding some vulnerabilities associated with web applications.

Limited Accessibility: Users must download and install the application on their devices, which may be a barrier for some users and limits accessibility compared to a web-based solution.

Platform Dependency: Windows Forms is primarily limited to Windows, restricting users on other operating systems like macOS and Linux from possibly accessing our software.
